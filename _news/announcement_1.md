Our paper [COGIS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10705087) was accepted to RA-L! COGIS estimates occluded obstacle geometries through interaction with the environment, including in cases without tactile sensing. It can also strictly enforce general, customizable constraints on the estimated geometries.
