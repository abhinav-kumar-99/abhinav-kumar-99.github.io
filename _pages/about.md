I am a Master's student in Robotics at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, working in Professor Dmitry Berenson's [ARM Lab](https://arm.eecs.umich.edu/).

My research focuses on adapting manipulation online to novel environments using online learning of implicit representations. I hope to expand my work to tackle hard problems in learning contact rich dynamics and more general problems related to online adaptation and inference for adapting large offline learned machine learning models to novel environments and tasks.

I also have a deep interest in public policy and national security. I have previously worked with the [Special Competitive Studies Project](scsp.ai), a think tank investigating the impacts of advanced technologies on many aspects of our lives as well as offering policy recommendations on how the government and private sector can maximize the benefit of these technologies to the American people. I have also worked with the Naval War College on studying the ethics surrounding emerging military technologies.

In my free time, I like to read: mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and history. I enjoy table top role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons as well as [thinking about the math](https://medium.com/new-writers-welcome/exploring-dice-math-with-explosions-6d558e36bfe5) behind them.
