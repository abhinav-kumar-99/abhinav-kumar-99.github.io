I am a Ph.D. student in Robotics at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, working in Professor Dmitry Berenson's [ARM Lab](https://arm.eecs.umich.edu/).

My research focuses on applying a combination of learning and planning techniques to dexterous manipulation, leveraging learning methods' inference speed and ability to learn directly from data with the constraint satisfaction and flexibility of planning techniques. In the past, I have also done work on ensuring constraint satisfaction of machine learning models to make them more useful in robotics where hard constraint satisfaction and safety are important.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, pretending I'm a film buff, and reading: mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and history. I also like table top role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons as well as [thinking about the math](https://medium.com/new-writers-welcome/exploring-dice-math-with-explosions-6d558e36bfe5) behind them.
