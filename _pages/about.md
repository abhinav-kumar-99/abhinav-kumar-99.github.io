I am a Ph.D. student in Robotics at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, working in Professor Dmitry Berenson's [ARM Lab](https://arm.eecs.umich.edu/).

My research focuses on applying a combination of learning and planning techniques to dexterous manipulation, leveraging learning methods' inference speed and ability to learn directly from data with the constraint satisfaction and flexibility of planning techniques. In the past, I have also done work on ensuring constraint satisfaction of machine learning models to make them more useful in robotics where hard cosntraint satisfaction and safety are important.

I also have a deep interest in public policy and national security. I have previously worked with the [Special Competitive Studies Project](https://scsp.ai), a think tank investigating the impacts of advanced technologies on many aspects of our lives as well as offering policy recommendations on how the government and private sector can maximize the benefit of these technologies to the American people. I have also worked with the Naval War College on studying the ethics surrounding emerging military technologies. A fun recent project was helping set up my friend's [campaign for state senate](https://ashwinforgeorgia.com), specifically setting up and tracking the finances and designing a policy platform.

In my free time, I like to read: mostly sci-fi, fantasy, and history. I enjoy table top role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons as well as [thinking about the math](https://medium.com/new-writers-welcome/exploring-dice-math-with-explosions-6d558e36bfe5) behind them.
